** What is a programming language?

   #+begin_quote
   "A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of
   strings that produce various kinds of machine code output. Programming
   languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer
   programming to implement algorithms." (Source: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language][Wikipedia]])
   #+end_quote

   * Formal language?
   * Set of strings?
   * Machine code?
   * Algorithm?

  * By-product of the UNIX operating system 1969 [fn:3]
  * Developed on DEC PDP-7 (8K words of main memory)0
  * Written originally in assembly language
  * UNIX rewritten in C by 1973 for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11][DEC PDP-11]]
  * Standardization of C, 1973-2018

  | Challenge: what does "8K words of main memory" mean? | [fn:4]) |

* How important is C?

  Some well-known programs written in C:
  * The Linux kernel (and therefore, Android)
  * UNIX operating system (core of MacOS)
  * Windows 1.0 to Windows XP
  * Doom (early video game)
  * Wolfenstein 3D
  * Git version control system
  * Clang and MinGW compilers
  * ...Any software that crosses platforms easily...

  See also: "[[https://youtu.be/smGalmxPVYc][Why C programming is awesome]]" (Hawkes, 2016).

** The Latin of programming languages

   The following languages are C-based:
   * C++ (OOP extension of C, games)
   * Java (OOP, VM-portable, and no pointers)
   * C# (Microsoft, games)
   * Perl (scripting, text mining)

   #+begin_quote
   "C is to programming languages what Latin is to Western natural
   languages." (Anonymous)
   #+end_quote

** Lightning fast and terribly tiny

   #+begin_quote
   "C is fast because it's the speed of light, and relativity?"

   * Excerpts for parsing and printing a Mandelbrot set
   * Benchmarks depend on algorithm implementation
   * C always wins the size battle (memory allocation)
   * Some very specialized languages are even faster


** Strengths and weaknesses

   | STRENGTH              | WEAKNESS                     |
   |-----------------------+------------------------------|
   | Efficiency            | Permissiveness (Error-prone) |
   | Portability           | Terseness and Understanding  |
   | Power                 | Large program maintenance    |
   | Flexibility           |                              |
   | Standard library      |                              |
   | Integration with UNIX |                              |

* What is the difference between C and C++?

  C++ is a superset of C.

* Why are we not just learning C++?

  * Object-orientation is a difficult paradigm (C++)
  * System programming is pure power (C)
  * C is simpler, smaller, and faster

  * Easy to pick up additional languages
  * Data structures and algorithms are key to understanding
  * First language could be anything[fn:8]

  It's personal.

  | C is small, simple, very fast, and close to the computer      |
  | Linux (and Android) are largely written in C                  |
  | The object-oriented programming (OOP) language C++ contains C |
  | System programming is a powerful skill set                    |

* Footnotes

[fn:8]My first real programming language was FORTRAN (specialized on
scientific computing), then C++. Recently, I picked up R (for data
science). In between I've sampled (not mastered) many others,
including: Python, Lisp, PROLOG, C, PHP, SQL, SQLite etc.

[fn:7]Torvalds (who wrote the Linux kernel in C) argues here in favor
of writing his hugely successful version control program ~git~ in C
instead of C++. He highlights sme of the strengths of C: efficient,
system-level, portable code.

[fn:6]However, he is biased, since he is the creator of C++. The title
of the video is misleading: Stroustrup believes that every C program
should rather be a proper C++ program. However, he also concedes that
C++ is still too complex for many ("We have to clean it up").

[fn:3]The motivation to create Unix, according to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Travel_(video_game)][Wikipedia]], was to
port Thompson's space travel video game to the PDP-7 mainframe
computer. So in a way we owe modern computing to gaming.

[fn:2]Since 2000, C has consistently ranked among the top two
languages in the TIOBE index (based on searches).

[fn:5]Answer: no. By 1966, there were already ca. 700 programming
languages (Chatley et al, 2019), today there are almost 9,000. C
descends from ALGOL60, other important languages are Lisp (functional
language), SIMULA (first OOP language), and PROLOG (logic language).

[fn:4]How many bits can be stored in memory of 8K words depends on the
bit length of a word (or byte). One byte holds 8 = 2^3 bits (binary
digits, or memory locations capable of storing 2 states). 8K byte
correspond to 8 * 2^10 = 8 * 1,024 = 8,192 bits. By comparison, the
main memory of my laptop is 16GB = 16 * 2^30 = 3.2E+31 bits. It
follows that UNIX (and C) had to be designed to be very small, or
space effective.

[fn:1]All sources are referenced at the end of the script, followed by
the footnotes, which do unfortunately not render as links [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc100/tree/main/history_of_c][on
GitHub]]. The book by King (2008) does not cover a few recent updates to
the ANSI standard for C, like C11, and the current standard C17. The
next major C standard revision (C23) is expected for 2023. Gustedt
(2019) is a good book on "modern C".
